title: Using the Apple Watch as a Mahalia Interface
date: 2023-01-16

It's possible to connect an Apple watch to the PHL and control parameters using the watch screen. The connection is via WiFi and it takes a few slightly inconvenient work arounds, but it is possible to replace the phone or computer with this smaller interface device.


## New Nodered 

* In the directory /etc/mahalia/nodered, delete the file openMHA...flow
* Restart PHL, or restart mahalia-nodered service somehow.
* Connect host computer to PHL via WiFi
* Open link 'http://10.0.0.1:1880'
* Use GUI to add controls
